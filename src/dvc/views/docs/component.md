# DVC - Component

**[Docs](/docs/) | Components**

DVC supports PSR-4 autoloading
A component therefore is simple a class
There are some build in classes

There are several html classes for instance and these are located in  the [application]/app/dvc/html folder.

Example:

```php
new dvc\html\div('hello world');
```

would produce

```html
<div>hello world</div>;
```
