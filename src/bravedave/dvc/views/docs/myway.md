## Introduction

Welcome to **bravedave/dvc**, an opinionated framework for building applications.

Frameworks are neither right nor wrong - they reflect their creator's priorities and style. Should a developer adopt someone else's platform wholesale? It imposes limitations and restricts creative freedom. Every project has unique requirements, and the best solutions are those crafted to fit your specific needs and values.

I want to share how I approach development in my own framework. By publishing my methods and tools, I hope you'll find inspiration, practical techniques, or even just some new ways of thinking about your work. **bravedave/dvc** represents my personal take on solving common problems and organizing code. Feel free to explore, adapt, or challenge any part of it - after all, the most important framework is the one you build for yourself.

Let's dive in!
