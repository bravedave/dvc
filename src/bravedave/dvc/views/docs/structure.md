<h3>Application</h3>

<p>The application set the basic environment and calls on the <strong>Controller</strong> to execute the application</p>

<h3>Model-View-Controller</h3>

<p>Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a software design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: the Model, the View, and the Controller. It is a popular architecture used in many web development frameworks, including PHP frameworks like Laravel, CodeIgniter, and CakePHP.</p>

<h3>Data (Model)</h3>
<p><em>Storage and Retrieval of Data</em></p>

<p>The Model represents the application's data and business logic. It is responsible for retrieving and storing data, as well as processing and validating it.</p>

<h3>View</h3>
<p><em>Display of Data</em></p>

<p>The View is responsible for rendering the user interface and displaying data to the user.</p>

<h3>Controller</h3>

<p>The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, receiving input from the user and sending commands to the Model to update the data.</p>

<p>The separation of these three components makes it easier to maintain and modify the application.</p>
