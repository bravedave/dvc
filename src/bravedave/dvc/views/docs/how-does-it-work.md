# How does it work?

## PSR-4

The coding technique is called [PSR-4 : Autoloading](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/)

PSR-4 is a coding standard for autoloading PHP classes from file paths. It specifies a standard way to map a class's namespace to its corresponding file path, enabling automatic class loading without having to include or require class files in every script.
