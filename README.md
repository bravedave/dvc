## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Requirements

- PHP 8.0 or higher
- Composer

### ↓ Installation

#### 1. create a composer.json

The application relies on the composer autoload features, this (very) basic composer.json file tells the autloader where to look for this application and installs *bravedave/dvc*

*composer.json*
```json
{
  "require": {
    "bravedave/dvc": "*"
  },
  "autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
      "": "src/app/"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. install the dependencies, create application and run the Dev server

```bash
composer u
vendor/bin/dvc make::application
vendor/bin/dvc serve
```

Then open [http://localhost:1265](http://localhost:1265) in your browser.
