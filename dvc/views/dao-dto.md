# Data - DAO/DTO

DAO/DTO is a traditional abstract method which uses Data Access Objects to
create Data Transition Objects.

DVC's DAO allow flexibility to use SQLite and MySQL with very little change
to code, most file structuring is automatic and does not require GUI tools
such as MySQL Workbench - a useful tool for visualization, but not required
for administration;
