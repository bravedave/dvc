# Components

DVC supports PSR-4 autoloading
A component therefore is simple a class
There are some build in classes

There are several html classes for instance and these are located in  the [application]/app/dvc/html folder.

Example:
<pre><code>
new dvc\html\div('hello world');
</code></pre>

would produce
<pre><code>
&lt;div&gt;hello world;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
