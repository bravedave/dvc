# DVC - Data View Controller

* Can be configured to work with any client side framework
  * jquery-ui
  * bootstrap
  * pure
  * materialcss

## Running
* Use Composer to Install this
  1. Install Composer etc.
  1. Download the Example Folder
  1. In that Folder (i.e. cd <folder>), where the composer.json is
  1. composer install

*To do all this, PHP would be installed and checked by composer,
  under Windows you can use the run.cmd
  to launch php with the PHP built in server*

## Runs Out of The Box
  * The default controller is called home, and it will be called outof the box, so this runs
    * The sample is bootstrap, but there is no requirement to run that, this is a server side framework, use whatever client side you wish
  * There is a sample controller called hello in the example/application/controller folder
    * http://localhost/hello
